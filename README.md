A little late to the game, but I been tuned in on the radio since they sang the national anthem. A seeker, poet, musician, and martial artist... I've taken a rather long time coming to fruition, alas.

But I've been interested in computers and the things we can do with them since I was a kid (my first program was in BASIC on an Apple IIc), but it's only now that I've graduated into so-called middle age that I have developed the requisite patience and conviction to practice software development enough to (yeah, I'ma say it) really develop.
